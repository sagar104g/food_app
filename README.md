# My React App - Food Ordering System

Welcome to my React app for ordering food online! This app allows users to browse through a menu, add items to their cart, and place an order with their address.

## Getting Started

To run this application, you'll need to set up both the backend and frontend components.

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder in your repository.

2. Install dependencies using npm:
    npm install

Start the backend server:
    node .

This command will start the backend server and allow the frontend to communicate with it.

Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.

2. Install frontend dependencies:
    npm install

Build the frontend assets:
    npm run build

This command will build the necessary frontend assets for production use.

Start the frontend server:

    npm run preview

This command will start the frontend server, and you can access the application through your web browser.

Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, you can access the application through your web browser. Here's a brief overview of how to use the app:

Browse the menu items available.

Add items to your cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

Review your cart by clicking on the cart icon.

Proceed to checkout, where you can enter your address details.

Place your order.
